# HeXOR

HeXOR is a collection of string manipulation functions I'm writing while I learn about crypto.

A lot of basic crypto stuff seems to involve converting ASCII back and forth between Hex representations (for portability) and XORing stuff, hence HeXOR.

I've written these in JavaScript because everyone else seems to use Python (yes that's my entire reasoning).

Nothing here is intentially useful for anyone else, if by some accident you find something useful, great :)
